# Overview of openEHR and Code4Health Ehrscape  
openEHR is a open specification for the information model of an electronic health record, published and maintained by the [openEHR Foundation](http://openehr.org).

The full openEHR specification is complex and beyond the scope of this simple overview. In summary, an application developer interacts with an an openEHR system and a standardised information model via a simple set of ‘service’ APIs.

openEHR does not itself create and publish EHR solutions or applications, rather it provides a specification for a key part of the technology stack on which other developers base their systems. The value of this approach is in reducing the effort to meet the needs of continually changing clinical requirements while increasing the likelihood of interoperability.

The information model and querying/persistence are defined separately via the use of shareable (normally open-sourced) archetypes and templates, There is no direct interaction with the persistence layer, instead all of the interactions with an openEHR system, including querying happens via the information model. In essence this is not dissimilar to the kind of abstraction provided by Django or Ruby Active Objects, but is designed to work with the health domain, is much more extensible, and is designed to work in a completely language and tecnology-neutral manner. 

openEHR systems can be built on any programming language, OS platform and with any persistence solution - examples of SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, mongoDB and MumpsDB solutions exist. It is the responsibility of the back-end developer to map their chosen persistence solution to the openEHR information model and querying system.

Ehrscape is an API wrapper for an implementation of the [openEHR](openehr.org) specification.

The overall structure of an openEHR clinical system is …
````
Physical CDR
 	Virtual CDR (Ehrscape Domain)
   EHR
    (FOLDER)
     COMPOSITION
      (SECTION)
       ENTRY
        (CLUSTER)
         ELEMENT
          name
          value
````

**CDR - Care Data Repository**  
All of the records within a single namespaced patient data repository. In the Ehrscape environment, a single physical repository is represented as a number of independent virtual ‘domains’ each of which can be regarded as a separate CDR.

**EHR - Electronic Health Record**  
The top-level container of all clinical records for a single patient.

**FOLDER (optional)**  
A high-level grouping of Compositions. Not implemented in Ehrscape, and not in common use generally

**COMPOSITION**  
A document-level container for all clinical records. This equates to an Encounter, a Lab Report, a Discharge summary, a set of Nursing Observations. All openEHR data is stored within the context of a composition and always includes clinical/medico-legal context such as patient, clinical author details, encounter times etc.  

The Composition is the container for structured/ coded data with granular clinical statements such as procedure, blood pressure, allergy expressed as an ENTRY, within which the leaf data is contained in ELEMENTS e.g Systolic, Diastolic, Cuff size.

Compositions are versioned and fully-audit trailed, so that previous versions can always be retrieved.

Two forms of persistence/versioning strategy can be employed

1) **‘Event document’ strategy**  

Most compositions will be saved as ‘events’. Each instance of the event creates an entirely new composition with a new unique identifier. This equates to a POST in Restful terms. Examples would be a GP encounter, Nursing observation or Discharge report. Updated versions of these kinds of documents would only be created if an error or inaccuracy needed to be corrected.

2) **‘Curated document’ strategy**    

A less common, but important versioning strategy involves ‘curated documents’ where it is important to hold a single instance of a named document, but which requires to be continually updated as a ‘source-of-truth’. Examples might be a Problem summary, a list of known allergies, or an End-of-Life Care Plan. The common factor with these type of documents is that there should only ever be a single instance which reflects the current known facts or understanding. Of course previous versions must remain accessible for medico-legal purposes.

**Versioning**  
openEHR systems handle versioning automatically. Any time a new version of an existing document is committed to the system, its unique compositionId identifier ‘version suffix’ is updated e.g

```
798e27b1-f2e8-48c3-8ced-42d4d27d1db3::c4h.hopd.com::1”
 ->
798e27b1-f2e8-48c3-8ced-42d4d27d1db3::c4h.hopd.com::2”
```
In normal operation only the most recent version of the composition is returned by querying or composition retrieval.

**SECTION (optional)**  
Sections are optional structures which are used to break up complex openEHR Compositions, gropuing the Entries into high-level headings e.g. in a Transfer of Care document, Sections might be represented as Allergies, Problems, Procedures, Lab tests etc. Sections are convenient for human consumption and navigation but should not be used to infer meaning.

**ENTRY**  
in openEHR, all of key clinical content is carried within one of the 5 ENTRY sub-classes ...  

(**OBSERVATION, EVALUATION, INSTRUCTION, ACTION and ADMIN_ENTRY**).  

The ENTRY is the container for structured/ coded data via granular 'clinical statements' such as Procedure, Blood pressure, Allergy within which the leaf data is contained in ELEMENTS e.g Systolic, Diastolic, Cuff size.

**CLUSTER (optional)**  
A Cluster is a branch-like sub-structure of an ENTRY which allow ELEMENTS to be conveniently grouped and possibly repeated e.g in a Lab Test archetype, data related to a single lab analyte result is grouped within a Cluster to allow the whole pattern to be repeated
 Lab Test
  Lab Result (Cluster)
    Result
    Comment
    Datetime reported
    Status

In the construct above the cluster allows multiple Lab results to be captured within a single Lab Test.

**ELEMENT**  
An Element is the leaf-node construct which is basicaaly a name/value pair with a defined datatype. The nature of the datatype determines the exact structure of the Element.

## Code4Health Ehrscape domains and EhrExplorer

   The [Code4Health Ehrscape](https://ehrscape.code-4-health.org/) openEHR service provided by [Marand](http:/marand.si) is configured to allow app developers to setup and work their own individual 'domain', populated with its own dummy patient data and openEHR content models and allows both read and write access to the data and for the upload of new openEHR content models.

   Each Ehrscape domain has its own login and password and in the near future may also be accessed via an Ouath2 session from  trusted provider.

   There are 2 methods of accessing the ehrscape API:

   1. Set up a sessionID variable via the GET /session call. This returns a token that can be supplied in the headers of any subsequent API calls. This is the preferred option since it avoids having to log in to  Ehrscape for every separate API call.

   2. Create a Basic Authentication string and pass this to each API call. This is simpler to work with, particularly where it is not easy to maintain a session variable e.g. in an API testing tool like Postman but incurs an overhead of having to resolve the username and password for each call.

### Requesting an Ehrscape domain

You can request an Ehrscape Domain via the Code4Health website. You will need to be a registered Code4Health user and access to your Ehrscape domain will require your Code4Health login and password. You will also need to provide a simple, unique 'domain name' such as 'handi' or 'cerner'. This will be used to create a unique internal server name such as 'ehrscape.c4h.handi' used internally by Ehrscape.
   an example of an ehrscape Domain that is being used for C4H Training might be

       login: ch4_training
       password: 223ergt$
       domain_name: ehrscape.c4h.training

	baseURL

 The baseURL for all Code4Health Ehrscape API calls is https://ehrscape.code-4-health.org/rest/v1

 ### Domain provisioning

 When your domain is setup you will be provided with the following

 1. Access to a personal domain on C4H Ehrscape with login, password and domain name.
 2. Access to the Ehrscape EhrExplorer tool.
 3. Acess to the Ehrscape ApiExlorer tool.
 4. The domain will be populated with
*  Several dummy patents
*  openEHR content models and dummy data for
*  Nursing Vital signs encounter
* Transfer of Care summary Report
*  Patient End of Life preferences
 5. A `workspace.md` text file describing the various identifiers for the login / password, exemplar patients, content models and dummy data.
 6. `Postman` collection and environment files

 We suggest that you fork this Git repository to your own account so that you can make changes to the content, code and documentation as you add your own examples.

### EhrExplorer

The Marand EhrExplorer tool can be used to create openEHR queries and to visualise the openEHR content models being used by your domain
   1. Browse to [EHRExplorer](https://ehrscape.code-4-health.org/explorer/)
   2. Enter the name and password for your C4H Ehrscape domain as above
   3. Leave the domain field as `'ehrscape``

![EHRExplorer](/img/ehr_explorer.png)
In the navigation bar on the left you can double-click on the `Vital signs encounter` template, which will open the template in the bottom-right panel. Right-click on nodes for further details of the constraints applied.

e.g. If you navigate to **'$$$'** and right-click you can examine the internal *'atcode'* constraints allowed for this element.

#### Ehrscape API browser

The C4H API Browser can be used to
   1. Browse to [EHRScape API Explorer](https://ehrscape.code-4-health.org/api-explorer.html)
   2. Press the ![Settings button](./img/tool_button.png) tool setting button and set userName to `c4h_train` and password to `c4h_train99`
   3. Any test calls in the API browser will now work against the Code4health Training domain.


#### Using Postman to test API calls

The [Postman add-on](http://getpostman.com) is vey useful for testing API calls outside of an application context.
[Postman collection and environment files](/technical/postman) are available for the C4H. The collection file contains all of the relevant Ehrscape API calls and a Postman Environment file matching your domain details will be created and which you may import.


## openEHR Archetypes and Templates - Clinical Information components
The C4H Ehrscape API consumes, retrieves and queries patient healthcare data using a standardised specification and querying format defined by the openEHR Foundation. openEHR is complex and can be difficult for novices to understand (even those with a solid technical background) but the Ehrscape API considerably simplifies the interface with openEHR systems.

[openEHR](http://openehr.org) provides a way for clinicians to define and share open-source, vendor-neutral clinical information components ('archetypes' and 'templates') which can be consumed, persisted and queried by different technology stacks, as long as they adhere to the openEHR specifications. Examples of archetypes used in this project are `'Procedure', 'Symptom', and 'Imaging result'`. These are managed by the openEHR Foundation using the [Clinical Knowledge Manager](http://openehr.org/ckm) tool and mirrored to [Github](https://github.com/openEHR/CKM-mirror), with a CC-BY-SA licence.

A repository of archetypes and templates designed for UK use is maintained jointly by NHS Scotland, HANDIHealth and RippleOSI at clinicalmodels.org.uk and and mirrored to a [Git repository](https://github.com/ClinicalModelsUK/ckm). HSCIC also have an openEHR CKM repository at http://ckm.hscic.gov.uk/ckm/.

## Overview of openEHR Reference model
The openEHR Reference model defines a relatively small set of information model constructs which openEHR back-ends must support. This includes a number of generic classes and datatypes.

The Reference model contains virtually no clinical content e.g concepts for Medication, or Diagnosis. These are defined and managed separately as 'archetypes'

### Key openEHR datatypes
openEHR has a very rich set of allowable datatypes. A full defiinition is beyond the scope of this document but developers new to this field may find the following notes helpful.

#### Datatype: text
**'text'** allows the recording of simple,unformatted text. openEHR does not normally constrain the length of string.

````
//FLAT JSON  
"asthma_diary_entry/history:0/story_history/comment": "Feeling much better",
````

#### Datatype: codedText

**'codedText'** is a commonly used datatype in openEHR systems and is a sub-class of text. i.e where-ever *text* is specified *codedText* can be used instead.

Codes may be 'external' e.g. SNOMED CT or 'local', where they are defined within archetypes, have the form 'atxxxxx' and are commonly referred to as **'atCodes'**

A codedText element always includes the terminologyID, the code itself and the text of the coded concept (Rubric).  
  Where a codedText item is required, allowed value(s) are expressed in the form:  

    terminologyId::code::rubric

    local::at0007::Dental swelling
    SNOMED-CT::123456::No pathology found

When a codedText item is added to a FLAT JSON format document, you must give the code, value and terminology, unless this is a local (atCode) code,
 in which case only the code needs to be provided.

##### External terminology e.g SNOMED CT

Code, terminology and value must be specified
````
//FLAT JSON
"asthma_diary_entry/history:0/story_history/symptom:0/symptom_name|code":     "23924001",
"asthma_diary_entry/history:0/story_history/symptom:0/symptom_name|value": "chest tightness",
"asthma_diary_entry/history:0/story_history/symptom:0/symptom_name|terminology": "SNOMED-CT",
````

##### Local 'atCode' e.g at0007

Only the code needs to be specified - the value and terminology are not required since they are pre-defined in the openEHR template..

````
//FLAT JSON
"asthma_diary_entry/examination_findings:0/pulmonary_function_testing:0/result_details/pulmonary_flow_rate_result/test_result_name|code": "at0071"
````
#### Datatype: ordinal
 **'ordinal'** is a datatype which combines codedText with a score, expressed as an integer.  

   *  0: Green  `local::at0022::Green`
   *  1: Amber  `local::at0023::Amber`
   *  2: Red    `local::at0024::Red`

````
//FLAT JSON
"community_dental_final_assessment_letter/assessment_scales/dental_rag_score:0/caries_tooth_decay/caries_risk|code": "at0024",
"community_dental_final_assessment_letter/assessment_scales/dental_rag_score:0/caries_tooth_decay/caries_risk|ordinal": 2,
"community_dental_final_assessment_letter/assessment_scales/dental_rag_score:0/caries_tooth_decay/caries_risk|value": "Red",
````

#### Datatype: count
**'count'** is a simple integer.  
````
" //FLAT JSON
"community_dental_final_assessment_letter/investigations_and_results:0/imaging_examination_result:0/result_group/decayed_teeth/decayed_teeth": 4,
````

#### Datatype: datetime
**'dateTime'** records a date or date and time using the [ISO8061 format](http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime).

````
//FLAT JSON
"ctx/time": "2014-09-23T00:11:02.518+02:00"
````


#### Datatype: quantity
**quantity** records a physical quantity along with the appropriate SI units, which should normally be compliant with [UCUM](http://unitsofmeasure.org).

````
//FLAT JSON
"asthma_diary_entry/examination_findings:0/pulmonary_function_testing:0/result_details/pulmonary_flow_rate_result/actual_result|magnitude": 550,
"asthma_diary_entry/examination_findings:0/pulmonary_function_testing:0/result_details/pulmonary_flow_rate_result/actual_result|unit": "l/min",

````

### Key openEHR concepts and classes

#### External identifiers

The subjectId (sometimes called externalId) is a patient identifier by which the patient is known outwith the openEHR system e.g. a hospital identifier or NHS number.

#### EHR
In an openEHR system, each patient has an ``ehr`` (a per-patient electronic health record) with a unique ``ehrId`` identifier (usually a guid). All references to openEHR patient data are via this ehrId. An API call `GET ehr/` is used to reference the ehrId from the provided subjectId/externalId.

Example ehrId: ``8fa77360-683c-4989-be5e-89a192624b43``

Other subsequent calls to the openEHR system for that particular patient are via the ehrId.

#### COMPOSITION
All openEHR data is committed inside a ``composition``, a document-level container which is given a unique ``compositionId``. If the composition is subsequently updated the root compositionId remain unchanged but its version number is incremented. All previous composition versions are retained for audit/legal purposes.

Initial version
``2cf04d6c-31e8-4599-a14b-9a0add4de5d9::fivium.ehrscape.com::1``

Revised version
``2cf04d6c-31e8-4599-a14b-9a0add4de5d9::fivium.ehrscape.com::2``

If you need to retrieve a composition, it is normally ok to simply use the root part ``2cf04d6c-31e8-4599-a14b-9a0add4de5d9`` which will return the latest revision in the current repository.


##### openEHR Composition file formats

In general, committing or retrieving a composition to/from an openEHR system involves sendining or receiving a structured XML or JSON file via a simple API.

The current standard **'canonical XML'** openEHR Composition format is defined by a set of [standard schema](https://github.com/openEHR/specifications/tree/master/ITS/XML-schema).  

More recently, openEHR implementers have started to develop alternative custom JSON formats ( usuually with converters to/from the canonical XML format).

The [Code4Health Ehrscape API](https://www.ehrscape.com/api-explorer.html), developed by Marand, provides a simple restful API which hides much of the complexity of the underlying openEHR server accepting simpler, flatter forms of composition data, using defaults within the template schema to correctly populate the raw openEHR data which is stored internally.

The `FLAT JSON` format is just a set of simple name/value pairs where the 'name' carries the path to each element. You do not need to parse this path. You should normally use this **FLAT JSON** format, which is easier for new openEHR users.

e.g.

````
FLAT JSON format:
   ... "community_dental_final_assessment_letter/assessment_scales/dental_rag_score:0/caries_tooth_decay/clinical_factors|code": "at0025", ...

STRUCTURED JSON format
     ... "clinical_factors": [
       {
        "|code": "at0025",
        "|terminology": "local",
        "|value": "Teeth with carious lesions"
      }
      ]	...

RAW XML format
  ... <ns2:value xsi:type="ns2:DV_CODED_TEXT">
          <ns2:value>Teeth with carious lesions</ns2:value>
              <ns2:defining_code>
               <ns2:terminology_id>
                 <ns2:value>local</ns2:value>
              </ns2:terminology_id>
              <ns2:code_string>at0025</ns2:code_string>
             </ns2:defining_code>
          </ns2:value>
       </ns2:value> ...
````

### Key openEHR Reference model attributes

A number of key data points need to be populated in an openEHR composition, which may not be apparent from the archetypes or templates. Developers can largely use the example instance documents and APIs for guidance but these notes may give useful background in addition to viewing the [UML view of the openEHR reference model.](http://www.openehr.org/local/releases/1.0.1/uml/index.html)

**committer** This is the name of the person physically committing the document ie. the person logged on to the account. If omitted from API calls, Ehrscape will use the domain login name.

**composition/composer:** This is the clinical author of the document i.e the person with clinical responsibility. Ehrscape FLAT and STRCTURTED formats handle this as ``composer_name``.

**composition/context/start_time:** This is the time that the clinical interaction with the patient began. Ehrscape FLAT and STRUCTURED formats handle this as ctx/time.

**composition/context/health_care_facility:** This is the healthcare facility / oragnisation under who's remit the encounter took place.

**observation/time:** This is the time that a patient's signs and symptoms were observed or a test was run. It is set automatically by the value of the ctx/time attribute. If you need to set the time of a specific observation you can use

The Ehrscape FLAT and STRUCTURED formats hide much of the complexity of these attributes, providing sensible defaults.
In particular the `ctx` header common to both JSON STRUCTURED and FLAT formats, considerably simplifies the composition header ...

````
"ctx/composer_name": "Rebecca Wassall",
"ctx/health_care_facility|id": "999999-345",
"ctx/health_care_facility|name": "Northumbria Community NHS",
"ctx/id_namespace": "NHS-UK",
"ctx/id_scheme": "2.16.840.1.113883.2.1.4.3",
"ctx/language": "en",
"ctx/territory": "GB",
"ctx/time": "2014-09-23T00:11:02.518+02:00",
````

###Handling specific openEHR datatypes

**text**  

Text handling is normally straightforward.

FLAT + STRUCTURED

 "synopsis": [
		        "Significant dental issues."
  ]

**codedText**  
For an external terminology, the terminologyId, code and text value must be supplied but in JSON FLAT and STRUCTURED formats only the local 'atcode' needs to be supplied.

````
		 STRUCTURED JSON format

		   Internal (local) code:
		   "dental_swelling": [
		           {
		             "|code": "at0006",
		           }
		     ]

		     External terminology:
		   "symptom_name": [
		       {
		         "|code": "102616008",
		         "|terminology": "SNOMED-CT",
		         "|value": "Painful mouth"
		       }
		     ]

		   FLAT JSON format

		   Internal (local) code:
		   "community_dental_final_assessment_letter/examination_findings:0/physical_examination_findings:0/oral_examination/dental_swelling|code": "at0006"

		   External terminology:
		     "community_dental_final_assessment_letter/history:0/story_history:0/symptom:0/symptom_name|value": "Painful mouth",
		   "community_dental_final_assessment_letter/history:0/story_history:0/symptom:0/symptom_name|code": "102616008",
		   "community_dental_final_assessment_letter/history:0/story_history:0/symptom:0/symptom_name|terminology": "SNOMED-CT"
````

**ordinal**  
For JSON FLAT and STRUCTURED formats only the local 'atcode' needs to be supplied although the ordinal and text value cacomplete are also accpeted

````
		 FLAT JSON format
		   "community_dental_final_assessment_letter/assessment_scales/dental_rag_score:0/caries_tooth_decay/caries_risk|code": "at0024"

		 STRUCTURED format

		   "caries_risk": [
		       {
		         "|code": "at0024",
		       }
		   ]

		   or

		   "caries_risk": [
		       {
		         "|code": "at0024",
		         "|ordinal": 2,
		         "|value": "Red"
		       }
		   ]
````

**date**  
Dates need to be persisted in the [ISO8061 format.](http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime) and should be displayed in CUI format e.g. 12-Nov-1958


### Tricky issues

**Converting UI checkboxes to/from codedText**  

In a number of places, the UI may best be represented as a set of checkboxes, while the underlying data is modelled as codedText.

e.g. Symptoms

While it may seem more easier and more logical to use a boolean datatype, this is a common pattern in openEHR datasets which are designed to be interoperable and extensible. Experience has shown that exapnsion of the target valueset and alignment to external terminologies is easier if an enumerated list of codedText is used rather than boolean.

In the case of 'Symptom' the rule is ...

    If the checkbox is ticked, populate the Symptom name with the SNOMED-CT term
    If the checkbox is unticked, omit the Symptom name element completely.

Conversely when loading a persisted dataset, the checkbox should only be checked if the Symptom name element is present and contains SNOMED-CT term 102616008.

**Multiple occurrence data**  

Some aspects of the form e.g Symptoms are handled as multiple occurrences of the same data point in the underlying dataset.
